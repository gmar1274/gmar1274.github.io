## My Projects

### Android TicTacToe Mobile Development

[View](https://github.com/gmar1274/Mobile_AI_TicTacToe/wiki)

- [x] Project Goal was to become familiar with native Android animation libraries and to demonstrate proficiency in Android native mobile development.

- [x] Implemented native animation libraries and media player.

- [x] App developed using Java.

- [x] Implemented one of the first Artificial Intelligence search algorithms called MinMax with alpha-beta pruning to reduce the runtime search efficiency.

- [x] Third party API's consumed include Google's Firebase NoSQL and AdMob.


### Android \& iOS Mobile Development

[View](https://github.com/gmar1274/Android-Firebase)

- [x] Project Goal was to recreate an app similar to Supercut's real-time reservation system.

- [x] Project to demonstrate proficiency with the Android and iOS SDK native mobile development,life cycle, and Model View Controller architecture (MVC).

- [x] Project functionality similar to Supercut's realtime reservation system.

- [x] Android developed using Java and iOS app developed using swift.

- [x] Technologies used: Android Studio and Xcode IDE, DreamFactory REST API Platform for creating custom web APIs, JSON for encoding/ decoding microservices, MySQL, Google's Firebase NoSQL, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instance to host the MySQL database.

### C\# Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) Development	

[View](https://github.com/gmar1274/FTNTransport)

- [x] Project goal was to create a WPF administrative inventory management dashboard  application for the independent trucking industry.
- [x] Portfolio project to demonstrate knowledge using the .NET framework and Model View ViewModel Architecture (MVVM).
- [x] Developed an administrative inventory management dashboard system GUI.
- [x] App written in C\#.
- [x] Technologies used: Microsoft Visual Studio IDE, XAML, MYSQL, PHP for custom web services, JSON for encoding/decoding PHP web services, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instance for hosting the database and PHP web services.

### Python Modeling - Senior Class Project

[View](https://github.com/gmar1274/ComputationalBiologyPhy409Project)

- [x] Went above and beyond class requirements. Goal was to recreate research publication that models botanical life using the Lindenmayer System.

- [x] Class project that demonstrate proficiency in Python and computational physics modeling.

- [x] Recreated a journal publication to model botanical structure using the Lindenmayer System.

- [x] Went above and beyond. Developed a GUI using the Tkinter module.

- [x] Used SciPy and NumPy modules for computing and plotting results of the research publication.

- [x] Technologies used: Eclipse IDE with the PyDev plugin for development.

### Raspberry Pi - OpenVPN Server

- [x] Project goal was to host my own secure virtual private network (VPN) server
		
- [x] Successfully created and currently maintaining a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for secured and safe web browsing on my Raspberry Pi.
		
- [x] Registered with No-IP (free dynamic DNS service) so that my OpenVPN server being hosted at home from my ISP can be resolved when doing a DNS lookup.
		
- [x] Engineered a layered home network and configured my firewall from my main ISP provided router and created a extra sub net using my TP-Link router for a separate controlled network testing environment.
		
- [x] Configured my TP-Link's firmware and installed OpenWrt on the device.
    
- [ ] Next step is to buy a mini USB travel router and install OpenWrt along with OpenVpn so that I can connect all my extra devices to my travel router without needing to generate individual certificates and keys for each client devices.
